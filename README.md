## Overview
This project involves a comprehensive analysis of Netflix's movies and TV shows data using SQL. The goal is to extract valuable insights and answer various business questions based on the dataset.

## Objectives
- Analyze the distribution of content types (Movies vs TV Shows).
- Identify the most common ratings for movies and TV shows.
- List and analyze content based on release years, countries, and durations.
- Explore and categorize content based on specific criteria and keywords.

## Dataset
The data for this project is sourced from Kaggle.

## Schema and Sample Data Insertion
```sql
DROP TABLE IF EXISTS netflix;
CREATE TABLE netflix (
    show_id      VARCHAR(5),
    type         VARCHAR(10),
    title        VARCHAR(250),
    director     VARCHAR(550),
    casts        VARCHAR(1050),
    country      VARCHAR(550),
    date_added   VARCHAR(55),
    release_year INT,
    rating       VARCHAR(15),
    duration     VARCHAR(15),
    listed_in    VARCHAR(250),
    description  VARCHAR(550)
);

INSERT INTO netflix (show_id, type, title, director, casts, country, date_added, release_year, rating, duration, listed_in, description) VALUES
('s1', 'Movie', 'Example Movie', 'John Doe', 'Actor A, Actor B', 'USA', 'January 1, 2020', 2020, 'PG-13', '120 min', 'Drama, Comedy', 'A sample movie description.'),

## Business Problems and Solutions

1\. Count the Number of Movies vs TV Shows

```sql
SELECT 
    type,
    COUNT(*)
FROM netflix
GROUP BY type;
```

Objective: Determine the distribution of content types on Netflix.

2\. Find the Most Common Rating for Movies and TV Shows

```sql
WITH RatingCounts AS (
    SELECT 
        type,
        rating,
        COUNT(*) AS rating_count
    FROM netflix
    GROUP BY type, rating
),
RankedRatings AS (
    SELECT 
        type,
        rating,
        rating_count,
        RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY type ORDER BY rating_count DESC) AS rank
    FROM RatingCounts
)
SELECT 
    type,
    rating AS most_frequent_rating
FROM RankedRatings
WHERE rank = 1;
```

Objective: Identify the most frequently occurring rating for each type of content.

3\. List All Movies Released in a Specific Year (e.g., 2020)

```sql
SELECT * 
FROM netflix
WHERE release_year = 2020;
```

Objective: Retrieve all movies released in a specific year.

4\. Find the Top 5 Countries with the Most Content on Netflix

```sql
SELECT * 
FROM (
    SELECT 
        UNNEST(STRING_TO_ARRAY(country, ',')) AS country,
        COUNT(*) AS total_content
    FROM netflix
    GROUP BY country
) AS t1
WHERE country IS NOT NULL
ORDER BY total_content DESC
LIMIT 5;
```

Objective: Identify the top 5 countries with the highest number of content items.

5\. Identify the Longest Movie

```sql
SELECT *
FROM netflix
WHERE type = 'Movie'
ORDER BY SPLIT_PART(duration, ' ', 1)::INT DESC;
```

Objective: Find the movie with the longest duration.

6\. Find Content Added in the Last 5 Years

```sql
SELECT *
FROM netflix
WHERE TO_DATE(date_added, 'Month DD, YYYY') >= CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '5 years';
```

Objective: Retrieve content added to Netflix in the last 5 years.

7\. Find All Movies/TV Shows by Director 'Rajiv Chilaka'

```sql

FROM (
    SELECT *, UNNEST(STRING_TO_ARRAY(director, ',')) AS director_name
    FROM netflix
) AS t
WHERE director_name = 'Rajiv Chilaka';
```

Objective: List all content directed by 'Rajiv Chilaka'.

8\. List All TV Shows with More Than 5 Seasons

```sql
SELECT *

WHERE type = 'TV Show'
  AND SPLIT_PART(duration, ' ', 1)::INT > 5;
```

Objective: Identify TV shows with more than 5 seasons.

9\. Count the Number of Content Items in Each Genre

```sql
SELECT 
    UNNEST(STRING_TO_ARRAY(listed_in, ',')) AS genre,

FROM netflix
GROUP BY genre;
```

Objective: Count the number of content items in each genre.

10\. Find Each Year and the Average Number of Content Releases in India on Netflix

```sql
SELECT 
    country,
    release_year,
    COUNT(show_id) AS total_release,
    ROUND(
        COUNT(show_id)::numeric / (SELECT COUNT(show_id) FROM netflix WHERE country = 'India')::numeric * 100, 2
    ) AS avg_release
FROM netflix
WHERE country = 'India'
GROUP BY country, release_year
ORDER BY avg_release DESC
LIMIT 5;
